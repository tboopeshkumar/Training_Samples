**V8 Engine** – JavaScript engine  

**Libuv** – A high performance , cross-platform evented I/O library. (Node Js use this for IO operations) 

**REPL** – Read, Evaluate , Print and Loop 

Node JS – We are creating servers in Node JS unlike using servers like Apache, IIS. So there is no intermediate.  

Two ways of code execution  in Node JS– **Blocking** & **Non Blocking** (default). 

**Modules** – *Built-in*, *3rd Party* & *User defined*.  

npm install --production : to install only dependencies  

package.json :  

preinstall  in scripts entry  - to install before npm install 

Non Blocking can be implemented by *Async callback* or *Event Emitters*  

Async callback functions (*Request & Response pattern*) : No partial results (for example error in the middle of file reading).  

**Event emitter** emits events ( *Publishers & Subscriber pattern* )
